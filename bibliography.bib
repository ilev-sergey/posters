  abstract = {In this article, we investigate the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics of HfxZr1−xO2 metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) thin-film capacitors with various Zr doping for varactor applications. The impact of field cycling during the wake-up process on the capacitance was analyzed. In addition, the effect of antiferroelectric-like (AFE) behavior on tuning was investigated. The transition between ferroelectric (FE) and AFE regime is particularly interesting for varactor application, as a reduced bias is required for tuning. The cycle dependence of the FE and AFE properties at elevated temperatures was also investigated, where it was shown that with an increase of temperature, the tunability is reduced. Temperature measurements also comply with recent studies of ferroelastic nature of AFE behavior.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently experiencing a bloom driven by deep learning (DL) techniques, which rely on networks of connected simple computing units operating in parallel. The low communication bandwidth between memory and processing units in conventional von Neumann machines does not support the requirements of emerging applications that rely extensively on large sets of data. More recent computing paradigms, such as high parallelization and near-memory computing, help alleviate the data communication bottleneck to some extent, but paradigm- shifting concepts are required. Memristors, a novel beyond-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, are a promising choice for memory devices due to their unique intrinsic device-level properties, enabling both storing and computing with a small, massively-parallel footprint at low power. Theoretically, this directly translates to a major boost in energy efficiency and computational throughput, but various practical challenges remain. In this work we review the latest efforts for achieving hardware-based memristive artificial neural networks (ANNs), describing with detail the working principia of each block and the different design alternatives with their own advantages and disadvantages, as well as the tools required for accurate estimation of performance metrics. Ultimately, we aim to provide a comprehensive protocol of the materials and methods involved in memristive neural networks to those aiming to start working in this field and the experts looking for a holistic approach.},

We show how VDSP can be advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO2, HfO2-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO4-based ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrated over 83\% accuracy across all devices using 200 neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as switching thresholds and HRS/LRS levels, and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.},

In the past, several classes of materials (such as polymers, ceramics, single crystals, and glasses) have been studied for these properties. However, because of a large deposition thickness (in micrometers or larger), these materials are inappropriate for future nanoscale devices. Recently, the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric HfO2-based thin films have also been studied for the energy-related and memory applications. HfO2-based materials have many advantages over the conventional materials, such as compatibility with Si-based semiconductor technology, ultrasmall thicknesses (nm), and simple compositions, and they are appropriate for integration within 3-D nanostructures. HfO2-based materials can be promising for energy-related applications, such as energy storage, pyroelectric energy harvesting, IR sensors, and solid-state cooling. This article provides some basic knowledge of these energy-related properties.

  abstract = {Transformations in the solid state are of considerable interest, both for fundamental reasons and because they underpin important technological applications. The interest spans a wide spectrum of disciplines and application domains. For pharmaceuticals, a common issue is unexpected polymorphic transformation of the drug or excipient during processing or on storage, which can result in product failure. A more ambitious goal is that of exploiting the advantages of metastable polymorphs (e.g. higher solubility and dissolution rate) while ensuring their stability with respect to solid state transformation. To address these issues and to advance technology, there is an urgent need for significant insights that can only come from a detailed molecular level understanding of the involved processes. Whilst experimental approaches at best yield time- and space-averaged structural information, molecular simulation offers unprecedented, time-resolved molecular-level resolution of the processes taking place. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical account of state-of-the-art methods for modelling polymorph stability and transitions between solid phases. This is flanked by revisiting the associated macroscopic theoretical framework for phase transitions, including their classification, proposed molecular mechanisms, and kinetics. The simulation methods are presented in tutorial form, focusing on their application to phase transition phenomena. We describe molecular simulation studies for crystal structure prediction and polymorph screening, phase coexistence and phase diagrams, simulations of crystal-crystal transitions of various types (displacive/martensitic, reconstructive and diffusive), effects of defects, and phase stability and transitions at the nanoscale. Our selection of literature is intended to illustrate significant insights, concepts and understanding, as well as the current scope of using molecular simulations for understanding polymorphic transitions in an accessible way, rather than claiming completeness. With exciting prospects in both simulation methods development and enhancements in computer hardware, we are on the verge of accessing an unprecedented capability for designing and developing dosage forms and drug delivery systems in silico, including tackling challenges in polymorph control on a rational basis.},

The development of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has enabled researchers to investigate ferroelectric domains and ferroelectric domain switching on the nanoscale, which offers a pathway to study structure-function relationships in this important material class. Due to its commercial availability and ease of use, PFM has become a widely used research tool. However, measurement artifacts, i.e., alternative signal origins besides the piezoelectric effect are barely discussed or considered. This becomes especially important for materials with a small piezoelectric coefficient or materials with unknown ferroelectric properties, including non-ferroelectric materials. Here, the role of surface charges and current flow during PFM measurements on classical ferroelectrics are discussed and it will be shown how they alter the PFM hysteresis loop shape. This will help to better address alternative signal origins in PFM-type experiments and offer a pathway to study additional phenomena besides ferroelectricity.},

In the last several years, the rapid development of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and spectroscopy revealed the presence of electromechanical hysteresis loops and bias-induced remnant polar states in a broad variety of materials including many inorganic oxides, polymers, and biosystems. In many cases, this behavior was interpreted as the ample evidence for ferroelectric nature of the system. Here, we systematically analyze PFM responses on ferroelectric and nonferroelectric materials and demonstrate that mechanisms unrelated to ferroelectricity can induce ferroelectric-like characteristics through charge injection and electrostatic forces on the tip. We will focus on similarities and differences in various PFM measurement characteristics to provide an experimental guideline to differentiate between ferroelectric material properties and charge injection. In the end, we apply the developed measurement protocols to an unknown ferroelectric material.},

At the nanoscale, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is the tool of choice for surface profiling due to its capability to noninvasively map the topography of almost all types of samples. However, this method suffers from one drawback: the convolution of the nanoprobe’s shape in the height profile of the samples, which is especially severe for sharp protrusion features. Here, we report a deep learning (DL) approach to overcome this limit. Adopting an image-to-image translation methodology, we use data sets of tip-convoluted and deconvoluted image pairs to train an encoder−decoder based deep convolutional neural network. The trained network successfully removes the tip convolution from AFM topographic images of various nanocorrugated surfaces and recovers the true, precise 3D height profiles of these samples.},

  abstract = {We investigated phase transitions in ferroelectric silicon doped hafnium oxide (FE-Si:HfO2) by temperature dependent polarization and x-ray diffraction measurements. If heated under mechanical confinement, the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase reversibly transforms into a phase with antiferroelectric behavior. Without confinement, a transformation into a monoclinic/tetragonal phase mixture is observed during cooling. These results suggest the existence of a common higher symmetry parent phase to the orthorhombic and monoclinic phases, while transformation between these phases appears to be inhibited by an energy barrier.},

  abstract = {Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films are one of the most appealing HfO2-based ferroelectric thin films, which have been researched extensively for their applications in ferroelectric memory devices. In this work, a 1 mol \% La-doped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin film was grown by plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition and annealed at temperatures of 450 and 500 °C to crystallize the film into the desired orthorhombic phase. Despite the use of a lower temperature than that used in previous reports, the film showed highly promising ferroelectric propertiesa remnant polarization of ∼30 μC/cm2 and switching cycle endurance up to 4 × 1010. The performance was much better than that of undoped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films, demonstrating the positive influence of La doping. Such improvements were mainly attributed to the decreased coercive field (by ∼30\% compared to the undoped film), which allowed for the use of a lower applied field to drive the cycling tests while maintaining a high polarization value. La doping also decreased the leakage current by ∼3 orders of magnitude compared to the undoped film, which also contributed to the strongly improved endurance. Nonetheless, the La-doped film required a larger number of wake-up cycles (∼106 cycles) to reach a saturated remnant polarization value. This behavior might be explained by the increased generation of oxygen vacancies and slower migration of these vacancies from the interface to the bulk region. However, the maximum number of wake-up cycles was less than 0.01\% of the total possible cycles, and therefore, initializing the film to the maximum performance state would not be a serious burden.},

DL allows analysis of unstructured data and automated identification of features. The recent development of large materials databases has fueled the application of DL methods in atomistic prediction in particular. In contrast, advances in image and spectral data have largely leveraged synthetic data enabled by high-quality forward models as well as by generative unsupervised DL methods. In this article, we present a high-level overview of deep learning methods followed by a detailed discussion of recent developments of deep learning in atomistic simulation, materials imaging, spectral analysis, and natural language processing. For each modality we discuss applications involving both theoretical and experimental data, typical modeling approaches with their strengths and limitations, and relevant publicly available software and datasets. We conclude the review with a discussion of recent cross-cutting work related to uncertainty quantification in this field and a brief perspective on limitations, challenges, and potential growth areas for DL methods in materials science.},

To date, it is widely accepted that the performance of HfO               2               -based ferroelectric devices during their life cycle is critically dependent on the presence of point defects as well as structural phase polymorphism, which mainly originates from defects either.

  abstract = {The nanosecond speed of information writing and reading is recognized as one of the main advantages of next-generation non-volatile ferroelectric memory based on hafnium oxide thin films. However, the kinetics of polarization switching in this material have a complex nature, and despite the high speed of internal switching, the real speed can deteriorate significantly due to various external reasons. In this work, we reveal that the domain structure and the dielectric layer formed at the electrode interface contribute significantly to the polarization switching speed of 10 nm thick Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) film. The mechanism of speed degradation is related to the generation of charged defects in the film which accompany the formation of the interfacial dielectric layer during oxidization of the electrode. Such defects are pinning centers that prevent domain propagation upon polarization switching. To clarify this issue, we fabricate two types of similar W/HZO/TiN capacitor structures, differing only in the thickness of the electrode interlayer, and compare their ferroelectric (including local ferroelectric), dielectric, structural (including microstructural), chemical, and morphological properties, which are comprehensively investigated using several advanced techniques, in particular, hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electron beam induced current technique.},

However, despite significant efforts, the mechanism of the polarization switching in this material is still under debate. In this work, we elucidate the microscopic nature of the polarization switching process in functional Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based ferroelectric capacitors during its operation. In particular, the static domain structure and its switching dynamics following the application of the external electric field have been monitored with the advanced piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) technique providing a nm resolution. Separate domains with strong built-in electric field have been found. Piezoresponse mapping of pristine Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films revealed the mixture of polar phase grains and regions with low piezoresponse as well as the continuum of polarization orientations in the grains of polar orthorhombic phase. PFM data combined with the structural analysis of pristine versus trained film by plan-view transmission electron microscopy both speak in support of a monoclinic-to-orthorhombic phase transition in ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 layer during the wake-up process under an electrical stress.},

Their exact origin remains controversial, and the relationship between ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties remains unclear. We introduce a new method to investigate this issue, which consists in a local controlled modification of the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties within a single Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 capacitor device through local doping and a further comparative nanoscopic analysis of the modified regions. By comparing the ferroelectric properties of Ga-doped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films with the results of piezoresponse force microscopy and their simulation, as well as with the results of in situ synchrotron X-ray microdiffractometry, we demonstrate that, depending on the doping concentration, ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 has either a negative or a positive longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient, and its maximal value is −0.3 pm/V. This is several hundreds or thousands of times less than those of classical ferroelectrics. These changes in piezoelectric properties are accompanied by either improved or decreased remnant polarization, as well as partial or complete domain switching. We conclude that various ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, and the relationships between them, can be designed for Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 via oxygen vacancies and mechanical-strain engineering, e.g., by doping ferroelectric films.},

Here, we report and experimentally demonstrate nanoscale tailoring of ferroelectricity by an arbitrary pattern within the nonferroelectric thin film. For inducing the ferroelectric nanoregions in the nonferroelectric surrounding, we developed a technology-compatible approach of local doping of a thin (10 nm) HfO2 film by Ga ions right in the thin-film capacitor device via focused ion beam implantation. Local crystallization of the doped regions to the ferroelectric structural phase occurs during subsequent annealing. The remnant polarization of the HfO2:Ga regions reached 13 μC/cm2 at a Ga concentration of 0.6 at. \%. Piezoresponse force microscopy over the capacitor device revealed an asymmetrical switching of ferroelectric domains within written HfO2:Ga patterns after capacitor switching, which was attributed to the mechanical stress across the doped film. The lateral spatial resolution of ferroelectricity tailoring is found to be ∼200 nm, which enables diverse applications in switchable photonics and microelectronic memories.},

Ultra-thin ferroelectric hafnium oxide films offer great potential for flexible memories due to their potential flexibility and perfect compatibility with modern technologies. This study presents ultra-flexible and stretchable memory devices based on 10-nm-thick Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film fabricated by an innovative technology involving encapsulation of the devices in a biocompatible organic package. They exhibit high memory functionality (remanent polarization of 27 µC cm−2) and withstand extreme mechanical conditions, including folding in half, multiple bending up to 150 000 bending cycles as well as tension with loads up to 1.5 kg. Further, flexible devices are employed as a platform to elucidate the fundamental role of mechanical stress in ferroelectricity of hafnia both experimentally and theoretically. Direct in situ experiment demonstrates that in-plane tension causes changes in spontaneous polarization, coercive voltage, permittivity, and conductivity. First-principle calculations explain the role of mechanical stress in ferroelectric and dielectric properties of hafnia. In applications, this work establishes a foundation for the implementation of biocompatible, high-performance flexible ferroelectric memory, and in the field of ferroelectric materials fundamentals, it provides insight into the critical role of the residual mechanical stress that is inevitably present in thin films.},

  abstract = {The nanoscopic nature of polarization reversal in hafnium oxide thin films consists in a combination of 180°-flipping of the polarization vector and ferroelastic switching. The shear piezoelectric coefficient is twice the longitudinal coefficient.           ,                             Ferroelectricity is in demand in many device concepts in electronics, energy and microsystem engineering. The performance of ferroelectrics-based devices is determined by either out-of-plane or in-plane polarization, or out-of-plane or in-plane piezoelectric strain. Real prospects for the practical implementation of innovative devices opened up after the discovery of ferroelectricity in ultrathin hafnium oxide films, due to their perfect compatibility with silicon technology. Ferroelectric properties of this material have been assigned to an orthorhombic structural phase with a single polar axis, but the spatial orientation of the polarization vector and the tensorial piezoelectric behaviour, which are inextricably coupled, still remain unknown. Herein, the rotation of the polarization vector in a Hf               0.5               Zr               0.5               O               2               (10 nm) capacitor during polarization switching and the spatial distribution of longitudinal and shear piezoelectric coefficients are elucidated at the nanoscale using               operando               vector piezoresponse force microscopy. In most of the capacitor, a 180°-flipping of the polarization vector is observed, which is consistent with the orthorhombic phase structure. However, a rather large fraction of the capacitor is also occupied by nanoregions of ferroelastic (non-180°) switching, which is explained by the effect of the local mechanical stress. To quantify the three-dimensional piezoresponse, a novel approach exploiting the Poisson effect in artificially created non-ferroelectric regions is proposed and it shows that the shear piezoelectric coefficient is twice the longitudinal coefficient. The experimental insights entail an important step in fundamental understanding of the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of hafnium oxide and have great potential to trigger new versions of ferroelectric-based devices.},

  abstract = {The development of the new generation of non-volatile high-density ferroelectric memory requires the utilization of ultrathin ferroelectric films. The most promising candidates are polycrystalline-doped HfO2 films because of their perfect compatibility with silicon technology and excellent ferroelectric properties. However, the remanent polarization of HfO2 films is known to degrade when their thickness is reduced to a few nanometers. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is the wake-up effect, which is more pronounced in the thinner the film. For the ultrathin HfO2 films, it can be so long-lasting that degradation occurs even before the wake-up procedure is completed. In this work, an approach to suppress the wake-up in ultrathin Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films is elucidated. By engineering internal built-in fields in an as-prepared structure, a stable ferroelectricity without a wake-up effect is induced in 4.5 nm thick Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film. By analysis of the functional characteristics of ferroelectric structures with a different pattern of internal built-in fields and their comparison with the results of in situ piezoresponse force microscopy and synchrotron X-ray micro-diffraction, the important role of built-in fields in ferroelectricity of ultrathin Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films as well as the origin of stable ferroelectric properties is revealed.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of the remnant polarization (Pr) growth during the first stage of ferroelectric HfO2-based memory cell operation (the wake-up effect) is still unclear. In this work, we reveal the microscopic nature of the Pr growth in functional ferroelectric capacitors based on a polycrystalline 10 nm thick (111) out-of-plane textured Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film during electric cycling. We observe the cycle-by-cycle evolution of the domain structure with the piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). During the early stage of the wakeup, three types of domains are found: (i) normal domains (polarization aligned along the applied electric field), (ii) nonswitchable domains with upward and downward polarization, and (iii) domains with anomalous polarization switching (polarization aligned against the applied electric field) that are commonly surrounded by nonswitchable domains. Initially, nonswitchable and “anomalous” domains are 200−300 nm in width, and they occupy ∼70\% of the capacitor area. During electric field cycling, these domains reduce in area, which is accompanied by the Pr growth. We attribute the domain pinning and the anomalous polarization reversal to the internal bias field of the oxygen vacancies. The local density of the oxygen vacancies decreases during electric cycling, thus producing the reduction of the internal bias field. The correlation of the PFM data with both the results of the structural analysis of fresh and cycled Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film by transmission electron microscopy and the performance of the ferroelectric capacitor indicates that after the first cycle of the wake-up the Pr growth is not associated with phase transformations, but only with the transformation of the domain structure. The obtained results elucidate the physical mechanism of the emergence of Pr during the wake-up of the ferroelectric HfO2-based memory cell.},

  abstract = {Hafnium oxide (HfO2)-based ferroelectrics offer remarkable promise for memory and logic devices in view of their compatibility with traditional silicon complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, high switchable polarization, good endurance, and thickness scalability. These factors have led to a steep rise in the level of research on HfO2 over the past number of years. While measurements on capacitors are promising for understanding macroscopic effects, many open questions regarding the emergence of ferroelectricity and electric field cycling behaviors remain. Continued progress requires information regarding the nanoscale ferroelectric behaviors on the bare surface (i.e., without encapsulation), which is notably absent. To overcome this barrier, we have applied complementary modes of piezoresponse force microscopy with the goal of directly and quantitatively sensing nanoscale ferroelectric behaviors in bare HfO2 thin films. Our results on 8 nm Si-doped HfO2 reveal nanoscale domains of local remnant polarization states exhibiting a weak piezoelectric coupling (deff) in the range 0.6−1.5 pm/V. While we observed localized enhancement of deff during progressive stressing of the bare HfO2 thin film, we did not detect stable polarization switching which is a prerequisite of ferroelectric switching. This result could be explained using polarization switching spectroscopy which revealed antiferroelectric-like switching in the form of pinched hysteresis loops as well as increasing remnant response with repeated cycling. As such, our results offer a promising route for material scientists who want to explore the nanoscale origins of antiferroelectricity and ferroelectric wakeup in HfO2.},

Recent studies show that the configuration of ferroelectric walls can go well beyond the conventional Ising‐type structure. Néel‐, Bloch‐, and vortex‐like polar patterns have been observed, displaying strong similarities with the spin textures at magnetic domain walls. Here, the discovery of antiferroelectric domain walls in the uniaxial ferroelectric Pb               5               Ge               3               O               11               is reported. Highly mobile domain walls with an alternating displacement of Pb atoms are resolved, resulting in a cyclic 180° flip of dipole direction within the wall. Density functional theory calculations show that Pb               5               Ge               3               O               11               is hyperferroelectric, allowing the system to overcome the depolarization fields that usually suppress the antiparallel ordering of dipoles along the longitudinal direction. Interestingly, the antiferroelectric walls observed under the electron beam are energetically more costly than basic head‐to‐head or tail‐to‐tail walls. The results suggest a new type of excited domain‐wall state, expanding previous studies on ferroelectric domain walls into the realm of antiferroic phenomena.},

  abstract = {The ferroelectric (FE)−antiferroelectric (AFE) transition in Hf1−xZrxO2 (HZO) is for the first time shown in a metal−ferroelectric−semiconductor (MFS) stack based on the III-V material InAs. As InAs displays excellent electron mobility and a narrow band gap, the integration of ferroelectric thin films for nonvolatile operations is highly relevant for future electronic devices and motivates further research on ferroelectric integration. When increasing the Zr fraction x from 0.5 to 1, the stack permittivity increases as expected, and the transition from FE to AFE-like behavior is observed by polarization and current−voltage characteristics. At x = 0.8 the polarization of the InAsbased stacks shows a larger FE-contribution as a more open hysteresis compared to both literature and reference metal−ferroelectric−metal (MFM) devices. By field-cycling the devices, the switching domains are studied as a function of the cycle number, showing that the difference in FE−AFE contributions for MFM and MFS devices is stable over switching and not an effect of wake-up. The FE contribution of the switching can be accessed by successively lowering the bias voltage in a proposed pulse train. The possibility of enhanced nonvolatility in Zr-rich HZO is relevant for device stacks that would benefit from an increase in permittivity and a lower operating voltage. Additionally, an interfacial layer (IL) is introduced between the HZO film and the InAs substrate. The interfacial quality is investigated as frequency-dependent capacitive dispersion, showing little change for varying ZrO2 concentrations and with or without included IL. This suggests material processing that is independently limiting the interfacial quality. Improved endurance of the InAs-Hf1−xZrxO2 devices with x = 0.8 was also observed compared to x = 0.5, with further improvement with the additional IL for Zr-rich HZO on InAs.},

Yet, knowledge on the ferroic and electromechanical response properties of this all-important compound is still lacking. Interestingly, HfO               2               has recently been predicted to display a negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect, which sets it apart from classic ferroelectrics (e.g., perovskite oxides like PbTiO               3               ) and is reminiscent of the behavior of some organic compounds. The present work corroborates this behavior, by first-principles calculations and an experimental investigation of HfO               2               thin films using piezoresponse force microscopy. Further, the simulations show how the chemical coordination of the active oxygen atoms is responsible for the negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect. Building on these insights, it is predicted that, by controlling the environment of such active oxygens (e.g., by means of an epitaxial strain), it is possible to change the sign of the piezoelectric response of the material.},

  abstract = {5G has been designed for blazing fast and low-latency communications. To do so, mm-wave frequencies were adopted and allowed unprecedently high radiated power densities by the FCC. Unknowingly, the architects of 5G have, thereby, created a wireless power grid capable of powering devices at ranges far exceeding the capabilities of any existing technologies. However, this potential could only be realized if a fundamental trade-off in wireless energy harvesting could be circumvented. Here, we propose a solution that breaks the usual paradigm, imprisoned in the trade-off between rectenna angular coverage and turn-on sensitivity. The concept relies on the implementation of a Rotman lens between the antennas and the rectifiers. The printed, flexible mm-wave lens allows robust and bending-resilient operation over more than 20~GHz of gain and angular bandwidths. Antenna sub-arrays, rectifiers and DC combiners are then added to the structure to demonstrate its combination of large angular coverage and turn-on sensitivity—in both planar and bent conditions—and a harvesting ability up to a distance of 2.83~m in its current configuration and exceeding 180~m using state-of-the-art rectifiers enabling the harvesting of several μW of DC power (around 6~μW at 180 m with 75~dBm EIRP).},

However, spike timing is just one of several factors (including firing rate, synaptic cooperativity, and depolarization) that govern plasticity induction, and its relative importance varies across synapses and activity regimes.

Our device consists of a double-gate 11nm-thin film Fe-JLFET with 10nm Si-doped HfO2 ferroelectric, mimicking the functionality of a tripartite synapse. The gradual ferroelectric switching is exploited to fully reproduce the synaptic plasticity. The back-gate voltage emulates the function of an astrocyte, being used to tune the synaptic weight by more than 400×. Compared to other implementations, the newly proposed tripartite Fe-JLFET synapse device shows simplicity in fabrication, extended programmability, and robustness.

  abstract = {This paper reports a 30 nm-thick integrated nano-electro-mechanical resonator based on atomically engineered ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide (Hf0.5Zr0.5O2) film. A 10 nm-thick Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 layer is atomically engineered through capping with 10 nm-thick titanium nitride (TiN) layer and rapid thermal annealing to promote the orthorhombic crystal phase with strong ferroelectric properties. The resulting metalferroelectric-metal (MFM) membrane is then patterned to create an integrated nano-electro-mechanical resonator with an overall thickness of 30 nm and a planar-to-vertical aspect ratio exceeding 104:1. Benefiting from large electrostrictive effects in ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, the 30 nm-thick nanomechanical resonator is excited into flexural resonance at 195 kHz with a very large vibration amplitude of \$100 nm. The transmission response of the nano-electro-mechanical resonator is extracted, using a two-port apodization of the TiN electrodes, showing quality factors (Q) of 15 and 3300 at atmospheric and 10À7 Torr ambient pressures, respectively. Finally, the structural robustness of the MFM nano-membrane is explored through the application of a \$24 lm deflection, using a point-force by a micro-probe, highlighting the extended elasticity despite the small thickness and ultra-high aspect ratio. The atomic-level thickness, fully integrated operation, high Q, and structural robustness of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based nano-membrane resonator promise its potential for the realization of highly integrated transducers for chip-scale classical and quantum information processing and sensing applications.},

In this material, noteworthy wake‐up and fatigue effects alter the shape of the polarization hysteresis loop during field cycling. Such changes are problematic for application of HfO               2               to ferroelectric memories, which require stable polarization hystereses. Herein, electrical and structural techniques are implemented to unveil how cyclic switching changes nanoscale film structure, which modifies the polarization hysteresis. Impedance spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy identify regions with different dielectric and conductive properties in films at different cycling stages, enabling development of a structural model to explain the wake‐up and fatigue phenomena. The wake‐up regime arises due to changes in bulk and interfacial structuring: the bulk undergoes a phase transformation from monoclinic to orthorhombic grains, and the interfaces show changes in and diminishment of a nonuniform, defect rich, tetragonal HfO               2               layer near the electrodes. The evolution of these aspects of structuring contributes to the increase in               P               r               and the opening of the constricted               P               –               V               hysteresis that are known to occur with wake‐up.

Visualization of polarization distribution and d33-loop measurements in individual 1×1.5-μm2 capacitors before and after stress application, generated by substrate bending, provided direct experimental evidence of stress-induced switching. Mechanical stress caused elastic switching in capacitors with the direction of the resulting polarization determined by the sign of the applied stress. In addition, stress application turned capacitors into a heavily imprinted state characterized by strongly shifted hysteresis loops and almost complete backswitching after application of the poling voltage. It is suggested that substrate bending generated a strain gradient in the PZT layer, which produced asymmetric lattice distortion with preferential polarization direction and triggered polarization switching due to the flexoelectric effect.},

  abstract = {Since ultrathin ferroelectric HfO2 films can be conformally grown by atomic layer deposition even on complex three-dimensional structures, new horizons in the development of next-generation piezoelectric devices are opened. However, hafnium oxide has a significant drawback for piezoelectric applications: its piezoelectric coefficients are much smaller than those of classical materials currently used in piezoelectric devices. Therefore, new approaches to the development of high-performance piezoelectric devices based on exploiting the unique properties of HfO2 are of paramount importance. In this work, a giant electromechanical effect in miniature piezoelectric membrane devices based on a 10 nm-thick ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) film is experimentally demonstrated. Compared to the pure piezoelectric effect in the HZO film, the gain of the electromechanical response in membrane devices reaches 25 times. Numerical simulations confirm that this effect stems from the asymmetric shape of the membranes and can be further improved by designing the device geometry. Furthermore, according to first-principles calculations, an additional opportunity to improve the piezoelectric coefficient, and hence, the device efficiency is provided by the engineering of the mechanical stress in the HZO film. The proposed approach enables the development of new promising piezoelectric devices including miniature reflectors, nanoactuators, and nanoswitches.},

Long-range polar or anti-polar order of such permanent dipoles gives rise to ferroelectricity or antiferroelectricity, respectively. However, the recently discovered antiferroelectrics of fluorite structure (HfO2 and ZrO2) are different: A non-polar phase transforms into a polar phase by spontaneous inversion symmetry breaking upon the application of an electric field. Here, we show that this structural transition in antiferroelectric ZrO2 gives rise to a negative capacitance, which is promising for overcoming the fundamental limits of energy efficiency in electronics. Our findings provide insight into the thermodynamically forbidden region of the antiferroelectric transition in ZrO2 and extend the concept of negative capacitance beyond ferroelectricity. This shows that negative capacitance is a more general phenomenon than previously thought and can be expected in a much broader range of materials exhibiting structural phase transitions.},

  abstract = {The ability of the brain to store and process information relies on changing the strength of connections between neurons. Synaptic facilitation is a form of short-term plasticity that enhances synaptic transmission for less than a second. Facilitation is a ubiquitous phenomenon thought to play critical roles in information transfer and neural processing. Yet our understanding of the function of facilitation remains largely theoretical. Here we review proposed roles for facilitation and discuss how recent progress in uncovering the underlying molecular mechanisms could enable experiments that elucidate how facilitation, and short-term plasticity in general, contributes to circuit function and animal behavior.},

  abstract = {Neural network technologies have taken center stage owing to their powerful computing capability for supporting deep learning in artificial intelligence. However, conventional synaptic devices such as SRAM and DRAM are not satisfactory solutions for neural networks. Recently, several types of memristor devices have become popular alternatives because of their outstanding characteristics such as scalability, high performance, and non-volatility. To understand the characteristics of memristors, a comparison among memristors has been made, considering both maturity and performance. Magneto-resistance random access memory, phase-change random access memory, and resistive random access memory among the proposed memristors are good candidates as synaptic devices for weight storage and matrixvector multiplication required in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Moreover, these devices play key roles as synaptic devices in research for bio-plausible spiking neural networks (SNNs) because their distinctive switching properties are well matched for emulating synaptic and neuron functions of biological neural networks. In this paper we review motivation, advantage, technology, and applications of memristor devices for neural networks from practical approaches of ANNs to futuristic research of SNNs, considering the current status of memristor technology.},

  abstract = {Mapping energy transformation pathways and dissipation on the nanoscale and understanding the role of local structure in dissipative behavior is a key challenge for imaging in areas ranging from electronics and information technologies to efficient energy production. Here we develop a family of novel scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques in which the cantilever is excited and the response is recorded over a band of frequencies simultaneously, rather than at a single frequency as in conventional SPMs. This band excitation (BE) SPM allows very rapid acquisition of the full frequency response at each point (i.e. transfer function) in an image and in particular enables the direct measurement of energy dissipation through the determination of the Q-factor of the cantilever–sample system. The BE method is demonstrated for force–distance and voltage spectroscopies and for magnetic dissipation imaging with sensitivity close to the thermomechanical limit. The applicability of BE for various SPMs is analyzed, and the method is expected to be universally applicable to ambient and liquid SPMs.},

The vast majority of force-based SPM techniques to date are based on single-frequency sinusoidal excitation and detection. Here, we illustrate the intrinsic limitations of single-frequency detection that stem from the fundamental physics of dynamic systems. Consequently, many aspects of nanoscale materials functionality including quantitative mechanical, magnetic and electrical measurements, as well as probing dissipative interactions, remain unexplored. Band excitation is illustrated as a universal alternative to traditional single-frequency techniques that allows quantitative and reliable studies of dissipative and conservative phenomena, and can be universally applied to all ambient and liquid SPM methods.},

The PFM signal is comprised of contributions from local electrostatic forces acting on the tip, distributed forces acting on the cantilever, and three components of the electromechanical response vector. These interactions result in the flexural and torsional oscillations of the cantilever, detected as vertical and lateral PFM signals. The relative magnitudes of these contributions depend on geometric parameters of the system, on the stiffnesses and frictional forces of the tip–surface junction, and on the frequency of operation. The dynamic signal formation mechanism in PFM is analysed and conditions for optimal PFM imaging are formulated. An experimental approach for probing cantilever dynamics using frequency–bias spectroscopy and deconvolution of electromechanical and electrostatic contrast is implemented.},

Wide-ranging explorations revealing the macroscopic performances and microstructural characteristics of typical antiferroelectric systems have been conducted. However, the underlying mechanism has not yet been fully unraveled, which depends largely on the atomistic processes. Herein, based on atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy, the deterministic phase transition pathway along with the underlying lattice-by-lattice details in lead zirconate thin films was elucidated. Specifically, we identified a new type of ferrielectric-like dipole configuration with both angular and amplitude modulations, which plays the role of a precursor for a subsequent antiferroelectric to ferroelectric transformation. With the participation of the ferrielectric-like phase, the phase transition pathways driven by the phase boundary have been revealed. We provide new insights into the consecutive phase transformation in low-dimensional lead zirconate, which thus would promote potential antiferroelectric-based multifunctional devices.},

In the 1st approach the model consisted in an excitation piezo, a holder plate and a chip where the cantilever was mounted on. A sinusoidal voltage signal was applied to the piezo in the simulation, which resulted in movements of the holder plate and finally led to the excitation of the cantilever. In the 2nd approach the model consisted only in a holder plate and the chip with the cantilever. The cantilever chip was examined in an accelerated coordinate system, in which the sinusoidally excited chip remained at rest. Results obtained by the different models were compared to each other. The advantage of the 2nd approach is its superior simplicity, which results in shorter processing time and lower calculation burden. The processing time according to the 2nd approach was found to be 3 times shorter than that of the 1st approach. We thus suggest considering to perform simulations of cantilever vibration modes within suitably chosen accelerated frames of reference.},

Analysis of the cantilever response using the damped harmonic oscillator model provides information on the stiffness and level of dissipation at the tip–sample junction as the sample is scanned. Since its introduction, this method has been used in magnetic, electromechanical, thermal and molecular unfolding applications, among others, and has given rise to a new family of scanning probe microscopy techniques. Additionally, the concept is applicable to any field in which measurement of the frequency response of harmonic oscillators is relevant. In this paper we present an analytical and numerical analysis of the excitation signals used in BE-AFM, as well as of the cantilever response under different conditions. Our analysis is performed within the context of viscoelastic characterization. We discuss subtleties in the cantilever dynamics, provide guidelines for implementing the method effectively and illustrate the use of simulation in interpreting the results.},

  abstract = {The brain has the ability to learn and evaluate as it receives and registers information. Signals between neurons are transmitted via synapses whose plasticity is modulated by usage. A bio-realistic electrical analog is a second-order memristor, where the short-term internal dynamics influence the long-term state. It is achieved here with an all-oxide multiferroic tunnel junction: La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 / BaTiO3 / La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. Similar to the modulation of synaptic weight by stimuli, multi-levels of resistance may be encoded by mean of voltage pulses, on long time scale and in correlation with short-term effects. Neuromimetic learning functions are demonstrated: short and long-term potentiation/depression, paired-pulse facilitation/depression, spike-rate- and experience-dependent plasticity. The threshold frequency of pulse trains at which depression changes into potentiation depends on the previous activity, with a sliding effect as in neurobiology. The voltage pulses induce reversible changes of both dielectric polarization and oxygen vacancies distribution, generating transient trapped/detrapped charges at the two interfaces that govern the dynamic response. The resistance levels are determined by the final cationic ordering (the redox Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio) at the two interfacial layers. The stimulation/relaxation dynamics are close to that in biological counterparts. Such memristors can be used in hardware artificial networks for advanced processing/storage of the information.},

All devices may be described using a compact phenomenological model of current conduction, showing that resistive switching originates from interfaces, through charge trapping. Remarkably, the processes of short‐term memory gain/loss and long‐term consolidation/forgetting are the same whatever the device type. Only the synaptic transmission weights and the excitation/relaxation times with respect to stimuli differ, as it occurs for synapses/neurons in the brain. The weights may be tuned by the sole use of the frequency of stimuli (the activity rate), their evolution being dependent on previous activities (the history). Metal and semiconductor devices display the same in‐operando dynamics of potentiation or of depression, the transition from one regime to another being history‐dependent. The threshold frequencies are slightly lower in semiconducting devices.

  abstract = {HfxZr1−xO2 (HZO) thin films have excellent potential for application in various devices, including ferroelectric transistors and semiconductor memories. However, such applications are hindered by the low remanent polarization (Pr) and fatigue endurance of these films. To overcome these limitations, in this study, HZO thin films were fabricated via plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD), and the effects of the deposition and post-annealing temperatures on the density, crystallinity, and electrical properties of the thin films were analyzed. The thin films obtained via PEALD were characterized using cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy images and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis. An HZO thin film deposited at 180 ◦C exhibited the highest o-phase proportion as well as the highest density. By contrast, mixed secondary phases were observed in a thin film deposited at 280 ◦C. Furthermore, a post-annealing temperature of 600 ◦C yielded the highest thin film density, and the highest 2Pr value and fatigue endurance were obtained for the film deposited at 180 ◦C and post-annealed at 600 ◦C. In addition, we developed three different methods to further enhance the density of the films. Consequently, an enhanced maximum density and exceptional fatigue endurance of 2.5 × 107 cycles were obtained.},

  abstract = {Ferroelectric polycrystalline HfO2 thin films are the most promising material for the implementation of novel non-volatile ferroelectric memories because of their attractive properties, such as compatibility with modern Si technology, perfect scalability, low power consumption and high endurance. However, for the commercialization of ferroelectric memory, some crucial aspects of its operation should be addressed, including the polarization switching mechanism that determines the switching speed. Although several reports on polarization switching kinetics in HfO2-based layers already exist, the physical origin of retardation behavior of polarization switching at the low and medium switching fields remains unclear. In this work, we examine several models of switching kinetics that can potentially explain or describe retardation behavior observed in experimental switching kinetics for Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO)-based capacitors and propose a new model. The proposed model is based on a statistical model of switching kinetics, which has been significantly extended to take into account the specific properties of HZO. The model includes contributions of the depolarization field and the built-in internal field originating from the charge injection into the functional HZO layer during the read procedure as well as in-plane inhomogeneity of the total electric field in ferroelectric. The general model of switching kinetics shows excellent agreement with the experimental results.},

In this work, Ru films with different thicknesses grown on a TiN layer by radical-enhanced atomic layer deposition (REALD) are used as an inert BE in TaOx-based RS structures. The REALD Ru surface roughness is found to increase by more than 1 order of magnitude with the increase in the reaction cycle number. Simultaneously, a wide range of RS parameters, such as switching voltage, resistance both in low and high resistance states, endurance, and so forth, monotonically change. A simplified model is proposed to explain the linkage between RS properties and roughness of the Ru surface. The field distribution was simulated based on the observed surface morphologies, and the resulting conducting filament formation was anticipated based on the local field enhancement. Conductive atomic force microscopy confirmed the theoretical expectations.},

  abstract = {Ferroelectric hafnium oxide (HfO2) is considered a very prospective material for applications in integrated devices due to its considerably large spontaneous polarization and superior thickness scaling. In fact, the evolution of the ferroelectric hysteresis upon field cycling plays an important role in most applications; especially the so-called wake-up effect that describes the increase of remanent polarization for initial field cycling, needs a profound understanding in HfO2. Herein, the discovery of electric field–induced crystallization in hafnium oxide is reported. In addition, differences in the wake-up behavior are addressed that finally can be categorized into five different cases, all being relevant when describing the evolution of ferroelectricity. Moreover, analysis of the temperature dependence and transmission Kikuchi diffraction provides insight into the underlying physical mechanisms of different wake-up behavior scenarios, and proves ferroelastic switching as the origin for the observed antiferroelectric-like behavior. This knowledge provides clear procedures of 1) how to experimentally quantify and 2) how to prepare and manufacture hafnium oxide phases for the five different wake-up types.},

  abstract = {HfO 2 shows promise for emerging ferroelectric and resistive switching (RS) memory devices owing to its excellent electrical properties and compatibility with complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology based on mature fabrication processes such as atomic layer deposition. Oxygen vacancy (V o ), which is the most frequently observed intrinsic defect in HfO 2 -based films, determines the physical/electrical properties and device performance. V o influences the polymorphism and the resulting ferroelectric properties of HfO 2 . Moreover, the switching speed and endurance of ferroelectric memories are strongly correlated to the V o concentration and redistribution. They also strongly influence the device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variability of integrated circuits based on ferroelectric memories. The concentration, migration, and agglomeration of V o form the main mechanism behind the RS behavior observed in HfO 2 , suggesting that the device performance and reliability in terms of the operating voltage, switching speed, on/off ratio, analog conductance modulation, endurance, and retention are sensitive to V o . Therefore, the mechanism of V o formation and its effects on the chemical, physical, and electrical properties in ferroelectric and RS HfO 2 should be understood. This study comprehensively reviews the literature on V o in HfO 2 from the formation and influencing mechanism to material properties and device performance. This review contributes to the synergetic advances of current knowledge and technology in emerging HfO 2 -based semiconductor devices. Graphical Abstract},

They are highly scalable, provide high operation speed, and consume low power. Just recently, an 1T1C FeFET concept with one transistor (1T) and one separated FE capacitor (1C) was demonstrated. This alternative approach is promising to overcome the drawbacks usually observed for the classic 1T concept like limited endurance, reduced retention, and high device-to-device variability. Electrically, the 1T1C FeFET consists of a series connection of the FE capacitor and the gate oxide capacitance. To operate at low voltages, a large fraction of the applied voltage must drop across the FE, which can be achieved by optimizing the capacitance ratio. Herein, 1T1C FeFETs with various capacitance ratios are fabricated and its impact on the electrical performance is discussed. Furthermore, the observed endurance of up to 108 field cycles illustrates the great potential of the new concept.},

One challenge in the integration of ferroelectric HZO is the need for specific capping layers to yield the most pronounced ferroelectric behavior; to date, superior HZO devices use titanium nitride or tantalum nitride, which limits HZO integration into various device structures. In this work, the authors demonstrate the use of elemental capping layers, including Pt, Ni, and Pd, for driving ferroelectricity in HZO. Different combinations of these capping metals, along with changes in the HZO thickness and annealing conditions, have yielded the optimal conditions for maximizing ferroelectric behavior. A remnant polarization of 19\,μC/cm2 and a coercive field strength of 1.07\,MV/cm were achieved with the Pt/HZO/Ni stack annealed at 650\,°C with a HZO thickness of ∼20\,nm. These results bring even greater promise to the use of HZO in memory and/or digital electronic devices by expanding the toolkit of materials that may be used for realizing ferroelectricity.},

However, device-to-device variation in threshold voltage (VTH) caused by non-uniformity of ferroelectric properties is a serious challenge for implementing hafnia-based FeFETs in high-density nonvolatile memories. Here, the substrate-orientation independent growth of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films is realized with uniform ferroelectricity by using HfO2 seed layers. The HfO2 seed layers are beneficial to improving the ferroelectric polarization of HZO thin films grown on differently oriented Si substrates and reducing the variation in ferroelectric properties. Moreover, device simulation confirms that the proposed scheme contributes to realizing uniform memory properties in 3D vertical HZO-based FeFETs.

Band‐excitation piezoresponse force microscopy and molecular dynamics are used to elucidate the nanoscale electric field‐induced phase transitions present in ZrO               2               ‐based antiferroelectrics. Antiferroelectric ZrO               2               is clearly distinguished from a closely resembling pinched La‐doped HfO               2               ferroelectric. Crystalline grains in the range of 3 – 20~nm are imaged independently undergoing reversible electric field induced phase transitions. The electrically accessible nanoscale phase transitions discovered in this study open up an unprecedented paradigm for the development of new nanoelectronic devices.},

We investigate how the displacement-noise spectral density dz at the input of the frequency demodulator propagates to the frequency-shift-noise spectral density dΔf at the demodulator output in dependence of cantilever properties and settings of the signal processing electronics in the limit of a negligible tip–surface interaction and a measurement under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. For a quantification of the noise figures, we calibrate the cantilever displacement signal and determine the transfer function of the signal-processing electronics. From the transfer function and the measured dz, we predict dΔf for specific filter settings, a given level of detection-system noise spectral density dzds and the cantilever-thermal-noise spectral density dzth. We find an excellent agreement between the calculated and measured values for dΔf. Furthermore, we demonstrate that thermal noise in dΔf, defining the ultimate limit in NC-AFM signal detection, can be kept low by a proper choice of the cantilever whereby its Q-factor should be given most attention. A system with a low-noise signal detection and a suitable cantilever, operated with appropriate filter and feedback-loop settings allows room temperature NC-AFM measurements at a low thermal-noise limit with a significant bandwidth.},

The obtained results reveal a transition from the nucleation‐limited switching (NLS) in the low field range toward the more uniform switching described by the~Kolmogorov–Avrami–Ishibashi (KAI) model in the high field range. It is found that the Al               0.72               Sc               0.28               N capacitors exhibit an unusually steep change in the switching time– it decreases by five orders of magnitude with a moderate increase of the applied field. This feature is caused by a significantly higher activation field value (≈126~MV~cm               −1               ) in comparison with the conventional perovskite ferroelectrics. PFM visualization of the field‐induced domain dynamics has allowed the evaluation of the nucleation rate and domain wall velocity. Furthermore, capacitors in the polydomain state generated by partial switching of polarization exhibit a significant (up to two orders of magnitude) increase in the steady‐state conductance. This effect is likely caused by the injection of strongly inclined conducting 180° domain walls.

While their polarization switching behavior has been widely investigated, their electromechanical response received much less attention so far. Here, we demonstrate that piezoelectricity in Hf               0.5               Zr               0.5               O               2               ferroelectric capacitors is not an invariable property but, in fact, can be intrinsically changed by electrical field cycling. Hf               0.5               Zr               0.5               O               2               capacitors subjected to ac cycling undergo a continuous transition from a positive effective piezoelectric coefficient               d               33               in the pristine state to a fully inverted negative               d               33               state, while, in parallel, the polarization monotonically increases. Not only can the sign of               d               33               be uniformly inverted in the whole capacitor volume, but also, with proper ac training, the net effective piezoresponse can be nullified while the polarization is kept fully switchable. Moreover, the local piezoresponse force microscopy signal also gradually goes through the zero value upon ac cycling. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the observed behavior is a result of a structural transformation from a weakly-developed polar orthorhombic phase towards a well-developed polar~orthorhombic phase. The calculations also suggest the possible occurrence of a non-piezoelectric ferroelectric Hf               0.5               Zr               0.5               O               2               .

The advantages of (111)-oriented PZT (\textasciitilde 1.2\,nm) include its multiple ferroelectric switching dynamics, ultrafine ferroelectric domains, and small coercive voltage. The FTJ shows high-precision (256 states, 8 bits), reproducible (cycle-to-cycle variation, \textasciitilde 2.06\%), linear (nonlinearity {$<$}1) and symmetric weight updates, with a good endurance of {$>$}10               9               cycles and an ultralow write energy consumption. In particular, manipulations among 150 states are realized under subnanosecond (\textasciitilde 630\,ps) pulse voltages ≤5\,V, and the fastest resistance switching at 300\,ps for the FTJs is achieved by voltages {$<$}13\,V. Based on the experimental performance, the convolutional neural network simulation achieves a high online learning accuracy of \textasciitilde 94.7\% for recognizing fashion product images, close to the calculated result of \textasciitilde 95.6\% by floating-point-based convolutional neural network software. Interestingly, the FTJ-based neural network is very robust to input image noise, showing potential for practical applications. This work represents an important improvement in FTJs towards building neuro-inspired computing systems.},

PFM spectroscopy of the local AFE/FE phase transition parameters is performed and their spatial variability via two‐dimensional mapping is investigated. It is shown that AFE hysteresis loops recorded by PFM in the bias‐on regime exhibit four characteristic amplitude peaks. Within the framework of Landau theory, these features are attributed to a considerable increase in the electromechanical strain response due to the dielectric constant divergence during AFE/FE phase transitions. The proposed approach can be used to differentiate between the antiferroelectric and nonpolar dielectric phases in functional devices using the electrically induced polarization.},

The further step in this direction includes the development of devices for data processing directly onchip, in particular, devices for neuromorphic computing. One of the key elements put forward within this paradigm is the memristor—the device emulating the plasticity of biological synapses. Due to the internal temporal dynamics of conductance, second-order memristors exhibit the most natural emulation of a biological synapse. Among different types of second-order memristors, ferroelectric memristors show the best cell-to-cell and cycle-to-cycle reproducibility. Here, we demonstrate a flexible ferroelectric second-order memristor on a mica substrate based on the 5-nm-thick polycrystalline Hf 0:5Zr0:5O2 film. The conductance (synaptic weight) modulation with ROFF=RON ratio \$20 is achieved via the gradual switching of the ferroelectric domains affecting the potential barrier in the structure. The devices demonstrate high reproducibility and various synaptic functionalities, including paired-pulse potentiation and paired-pulse depression. Functional properties persist both during static bending and after more than 100 bending cycles with a radius down to 1 cm.},

  abstract = {Ferroelectric polycrystalline hafnium oxide films hold great promise for the electronics industry, though an understanding of ferroelectricity in this unconventional material is still lacking. Here, by an in situ synchrotron Xray microdiffraction experiment, we reveal an important role of reversible and irreversible ferroelastic switching in the mechanism of polarization reversal in a 10 nm thick Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film and in the origin of the so called wake-up effect consisting in a gradual increase in the remanent polarization of as-prepared memory structures. During the wake-up, the oblique polar axis irreversibly rotates in some ferroelectric orthorhombic grains and becomes more vertical on average in the film, which is the mechanism of the increase in measured polarization. This effect originates from the tensile stress emerging in the film during crystallization annealing and its gradual decrease via the rearrangement of the crystal lattice, which is consistent with first-principles calculations. In the woken-up structures, the polar axis also rotates during polarization switching, but reversibly, which means a different crystal structure of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 in the upward and downward polarization states and breaking the inversion symmetry. The results provide insight into fundamentals of ferroelectric hafnium oxide and points the way for intelligent material engineering in the field of ferroelectrics-based devices.},

In this work, the Kolmogorov–Avrami–Ishibashi (KAI), the Nucleation Limited Switching (NLS), the Landau–Khalatnikov (LK), and the Inhomogeneous Field Mechanism (IFM) models for polarization switching are surveyed and evaluated with the existing body of literature. Data concerning NLS and IFM are compared to experiments undertaken in this study. After excluding the KAI model because of considerations dealing with film morphology and domain wall energy, we conclude that the NLS, the LK, and the IFM models do not necessarily mutually exclude each other, but rather give a diverse perspective on the switching phenomenon based on thermodynamic, kinetic, statistic, microscopic, and/or macroscopic points of view.},

The binary mixture of HfO               2               and ZrO               2               , Hf                                x                              Zr                                x                              −1               O               2               , showed the widest process window in terms of polarization, but other memory related aspects still need improvement. Recently, the co‐doping of La into a mixed Hf               0.5               Zr               0.5               O               2               , La:HZO, was reported to improve the endurance properties further but the explanation spanning both structural and electrical characteristics of La:HZO and their interaction is still missing. In this work, an extensive study of La:HZO with La content ranging from 0 to 4.3 mol\% is conducted and resultant stabilization of nonpolar tetragonal phase, coercive field reduction, endurance improvement, stronger retention loss, and less imprinted hysteresis loop is reported with increasing La concentration. The model simultaneously explaining the electrical and structural properties is presented. In ferroelectric capacitor structures, the depolarization fields originating from nonferroelectric layers at the metal/ferroelectric interface are discussed extensively in previous studies but, here, for the first time, the impact of depolarization fields from nonferroelectric regions in the bulk of the ferroelectric material is reported, which is an important element to explain all the observed trends.},

As a result, the dynamics of such devices allows to naturally emulate the temporal behavior of biological synapses, which encodes the spike timing information in synaptic weights. Here, we demonstrate a new type of second-order memristor functionality in the ferroelectric HfO2-based tunnel junction on silicon. The continuous change of conductance in the p+Si/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/TiN tunnel junction is achieved via the gradual switching of polarization in ferroelectric domains of polycrystalline Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 layer, whereas the combined dynamics of the built-in electric field and charge trapping/detrapping at the defect states at the bottom Si interface defines the temporal behavior of the memristor device, similar to synapses in biological systems. The implemented ferroelectric second-order memristor exhibits various synaptic functionalities, such as paired-pulse potentiation/depression and spike-rate-dependent plasticity, and can serve as a building block for the development of neuromorphic computing architectures.},

  abstract = {New interest in the implementation of ferroelectric tunnel junctions has emerged following the discovery of ferroelectric properties in HfO2 films, which are fully compatible with silicon microelectronics technology. The coercive electric field to switch polarization direction in ferroelectric HfO2 is relatively high compared to classical perovskite materials, and thus it can cause the migration of non-ferroelectric charges in HfO2, namely charged oxygen vacancies. The charge redistribution would cause the change of the tunnel barrier shape and following change of the electroresistance effect. In the case of ambiguous ferroelectric properties of HfO2 ultrathin films, this oxygen-driven resistive switching effect can mimic the tunnel electroresistance effect. Here, we demonstrate two separate resistive switching regimes, depending on the applied voltage, in the same memristor device employing a ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (4.5 nm) layer. The first regime originates from the polarization reversal, whereas the second one is attributed to the accumulation/depletion of the oxygen vacancies at the electrode interface. The modulation of the tunnel barrier causes the enhancement of ROFF/RON ratio in ∼20 times compared to the tunnel electroresistance effect. The developed device was used to formulate the criteria for unambiguous discrimination between the ferroelectric-and non-ferroelectric resistive switching effects in HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junctions.},

This artificial synapse is designed to emulate crucial learning behaviors fundamental to in-memory computing. We systematically explore synaptic plasticity dynamics by implementing pulse measurements capturing potentiation and depression traits akin to biological synapses under flat and different bending conditions, thereby highlighting its potential suitability for flexible electronic applications. The findings demonstrate that the memristor accurately replicates essential properties of biological synapses, including short-term plasticity (STP), long-term plasticity (LTP), and the intriguing transition from STP to LTP. Furthermore, other variables are investigated, such as paired-pulse facilitation, spike rate-dependent plasticity, spike time-dependent plasticity, pulse duration-dependent plasticity, and pulse amplitude-dependent plasticity. Utilizing data from flat and differently bent synapses, neural network simulations for pattern recognition tasks using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset reveal a high recognition accuracy of ∼95\% with a fast learning speed that requires only 15 epochs to reach saturation.},

Fortunately, the innovation of nanomaterials (NMs) and their corresponding processing into devices and electrodes could enhance the functionality and/or advancement of the current battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Patent landscape analysis (PLA) can offer a comprehensive overview of technological development trends and enable discussion in interdisciplinary areas that facilitate more rational technology planning in the future. In this study, PLA of recent advancements in the NM-based BESS was critically analyzed, future technologies forecasted, and potential challenges outlined. A search was performed in the Lens database using “energy storage system,” “battery,” and “nanomaterial,” and related patents under the simple family were extracted. Finally, after excluding duplicates and irrelevant patents, a total of 89 patents were selected for analysis using various parameters. The article provides a current technical overview along with an extensive bibliographic review of the patent family, trends of patent growth, key inventors and owners, patent legal status, patent jurisdiction, top cited patents, etc., as well as technological updates. Overall, nanotechnology has great potential for the future; however, further research and studies are necessary to accelerate the widespread usage of NMs in energy storage systems using cost-effective and environmentally friendly technologies.},

For the first time it is shown that the intensively researched HfO               2               thin films (16 nm) also possess ferroelectric properties when aluminium is incorporated into the host lattice. Polarization measurements on Al:HfO               2               based metal–insulator–metal capacitors show an antiferroelectric‐to‐ferroelectric phase transition depending on annealing conditions and aluminium content. Structural investigation of the electrically characterized capacitors by grazing incidence X‐ray diffraction is presented in order to gain further insight on the potential origin of ferroelectricity. The non‐centrosymmetry of the elementary cell, which is essential for ferroelectricity, is assumed to originate from an orthorhombic phase of space group Pbc2               1               stabilized for low Al doping in HfO               2               . The ferroelectric properties of the modified HfO               2               thin films yield high potential for various ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric applications. Furthermore, due to the extensive knowledge accumulated by various research groups regarding the HfO               2               dielectric, an immediate relevance of ferroelectric hafnium oxide thin films is anticipated by the authors.},

Extensive retention, imprint, and endurance data for this new type of ferroelectric material are presented for the first time. The variability of reliability characteristics in terms of capacitor annealing temperatures as well as excitation amplitude effects is analyzed. Stable ferroelectric switching behavior can be observed in a wide temperature range from 80 K up to 470 K. Bake tests at 125 ◦C show almost no retention loss for saturated polarization states up to cumulative testing times of 1000 h. In addition to the same-state retention, opposite-state retention was observed to be equally stable. Traditional imprint behavior of the programmed state occurs after a few hours of baking time, and stable behavior could be verified until the end of the 1000-h retention test. Endurance characteristics of the ferroelectric thin films are shown to depend significantly on the annealing temperature of the capacitors and on the cycling voltage during testing. In thin films which had been annealed at 1000 ◦C, breakdown at 2 MV/cm limits endurance after 108 cycles. A lower annealing temperature of 650 ◦C could improve the breakdown-limited endurance to 1010 cycles.},

Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction of the 10 nm thick films revealed an orthorhombic phase close to the stability region of the cubic phase. The potential ferroelectricity of this orthorhombic phase was confirmed by polarization hysteresis measurements on titanium nitride based metal-insulator-metal capacitors. For 5.2 mol\% YO1.5 admixture the remanent polarization peaked at 24 μC/cm2 with a coercive field of about 1.2 MV/cm. Considering the availability of conformal deposition processes and CMOS-compatibility, ferroelectric Y:HfO2 implies high scaling potential for future, ferroelectric memories.},

Electromagnetic harvesters are a standout among various types of vibrational harvesters due to their ability to capture kinetic energy in a low-frequency range. This leads to these devices being more applicable in real-world applications where ambient vibrations are typical of having low frequencies.

HZO thin films were deposited by chemical solution deposition on the Pt bottom electrodes with various grain sizes which had been deposited by direct current sputter‑ing. All the samples were crystallized by rapid thermal annealing at 700 °C to allow a phase transformation. The crys‑tallographic phases were determined by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, which showed that the bottom electrode with smaller Pt grains resulted in a larger orthorhombic phase composition in the HZO film. As a result, capacitors with smaller Pt grains for the bottom electrode showed greater ferroelectric polarization. The smaller grains produced larger in-plane stress which led to more orthorhombic phase transformation and higher ferroelectric polarization.},

We present an in\hphantom{,}situ experimental procedure to determine the response of a cantilever to lateral forces in terms of its normal force response. This procedure is quite general. It will work with any type of deflection sensor and does not require the knowledge or direct measurement of the lever dimensions or the tip height. In addition, the shape of the tip apex can be determined. We also discuss a number of specific issues related to force and friction measurements using optical lever deflection sensing. We present experimental results on the lateral force response of commercially available V-shaped cantilevers. Our results are consistent with estimates of lever mechanical properties using continuum elasticity theory.},

Most ferroelectric thin film research focuses on perovskite structure materials, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, BaTiO3, and SrBi2Ta2O9, which are considered to be feasible candidate materials for non-volatile semiconductor memory devices. However, these conventional ferroelectrics suffer from various problems including poor Si-compatibility, environmental issues related to Pb, large physical thickness, low resistance to hydrogen, and small bandgap. In 2011, ferroelectricity in Si-doped HfO2 thin films was first reported. Various dopants, such as Si, Zr, Al, Y, Gd, Sr, and La can induce ferro­electricity or antiferroelectricity in thin HfO2 films. They have large remanent polarization of up to 45 μC cm−2, and their coercive field (≈1–2 MV cm−1) is larger than conventional ferroelectric films by approximately one order of magnitude. Furthermore, they can be extremely thin ({$<$}10 nm) and have a large bandgap ({$>$}5 eV). These differences are believed to overcome the barriers of conventional ferroelectrics in memory applications, including ferroelectric field-effect-transistors and three-dimensional capacitors. Moreover, the coupling of electric and thermal properties of the antiferroelectric thin films is expected to be useful for various applications, including energy harvesting/storage, solid-state-cooling, and infrared sensors.},

  abstract = {HfO2-based ferroelectric thin films have attracted significant interest for semiconductor device applications due to their compatibility with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. One of the benefits of HfO2-based ferroelectric thin films is their ability to be scaled to thicknesses as low as 10 nm while retaining their ferroelectric properties; a feat that has been difficult to accomplish with conventional perovskite-based ferroelectrics using CMOScompatible processes. However, reducing the thickness limit of HfO2-based ferroelectric thin films below the sub 5 nm thickness regime while preserving their ferroelectric property remains a formidable challenge. This is because both the structural factors of HfO2, including polymorphism and orientation, and the electrical factors of HfO2-based devices, such as the depolarization field, are known to be highly dependent on the HfO2 thickness. Accordingly, when the thickness of HfO2 drops below 5 nm, these factors will become even more crucial. In this regard, the size effect of HfO2-based ferroelectric thin films is thoroughly discussed in the present review. The impact of thickness on the ferroelectric property of HfO2-based thin films and the electrical performance of HfO2-based ferroelectric semiconductor devices, such as ferroelectric random-access-memory, ferroelectric field-effect-transistor, and ferroelectric tunnel junction, is extensively discussed from the perspective of fundamental theory and experimental results. Finally, recent developments and reports on achieving ferroelectric HfO2 at sub-5 nm thickness regime and their applications are discussed.},

The discovery of ferroelectricity in fluorite‐structured oxides revived interest in the research on ferroelectric memories, by inducing nanoscale nonvolatility in state‐of‐the‐art gate insulators by minute doping and thermal treatment. The potential of this approach has been demonstrated by the fabrication of sub‐30~nm electronic devices. Nonetheless, to realize practical applications, various technical limitations, such as insufficient reliability including endurance, retention, and imprint, as well as large device‐to‐device‐variation, require urgent solutions. Furthermore, such limitations should be considered based on targeting devices as well as applications. Various types of ferroelectric memories including ferroelectric random‐access‐memory, ferroelectric field‐effect‐transistor, and ferroelectric tunnel junction should be considered for classical nonvolatile memories as well as emerging neuromorphic computing and processing‐in‐memory. Therefore, from the viewpoint of materials science, this review covers the recent research focusing on ferroelectric memories from the history of conventional approaches to future prospects.},

The theoretical model can semi-quantitatively explain the experimental results on the phase-evolution, but there were non-negligible discrepancies between the two results. To understand these discrepancies, various factors such as the film stress, the role of a TiN capping layer, and the kinetics of crystallization are systematically studied. This work also reports on the evolution of electrical properties of the film,               i.e.               dielectric, ferroelectric, anti-ferroelectric, and morphotropic phase changes, as a function of the film composition and thickness. The in-depth analyses of the phase change are expected to provide an important guideline for subsequent studies.},

Within the lifetime of the device, two main regimes of wake‐up and fatigue can be identified. Up to now, the mechanisms behind these two device stages have not been revealed. Thus, the main scope of this study is an identification of the root cause for the increase of the remnant polarization during the wake‐up phase and subsequent polarization degradation with further cycling. Combining the comprehensive ferroelectric switching current experiments, Preisach density analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study with compact and Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) modeling, it has been found out that during the wake‐up of the device no new defects are generated but the existing defects redistribute within the device. Furthermore, vacancy diffusion has been identified as the main cause for the phase transformation and consequent increase of the remnant polarization. Utilizing trap density spectroscopy for examining defect evolution with cycling of the device together with modeling of the degradation results in an understanding of the main mechanisms behind the evolution of the ferroelectric response.},

  abstract = {Photolithography (also known as optical lithography) is a process used in the manufacturing of integrated circuits. It involves using light to transfer a pattern onto a substrate, typically a silicon wafer. The process begins with a photosensitive material, called a photoresist, being applied to the substrate. A photomask that contains the desired pattern is then placed over the photoresist. Light is shone through the photomask, exposing the photoresist in certain areas. The exposed areas undergo a chemical change, making them either soluble or insoluble in a developer solution. After development, the pattern is transferred onto the substrate through etching, chemical vapor deposition, or ion implantation processes. Ultraviolet (UV) light is typically used. Photolithography processes can be classified according to the type of light used, including ultraviolet lithography, deep ultraviolet lithography, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), and X-ray lithography. The wavelength of light used determines the minimum feature size that can be formed in the photoresist. Photolithography is the most common method for the semiconductor fabrication of integrated circuits ("ICs" or "chips"), such as solid-state memories and microprocessors. It can create extremely small patterns, down to a few nanometers in size. It provides precise control of the shape and size of the objects it creates. It can create patterns over an entire wafer in a single step, quickly and with relatively low cost. In complex integrated circuits, a wafer may go through the photolithographic cycle as many as 50 times. It is also an important technique for microfabrication in general, such as the fabrication of microelectromechanical systems. However, photolithography cannot be used to produce masks on surfaces that are not perfectly flat. And, like all chip manufacturing processes, it requires extremely clean operating conditions. Photolithography is a subclass of microlithography, the general term for processes that generate patterned thin films. Other technologies in this broader class include the use of steerable electron beams, or more rarely, nanoimprinting, interference, magnetic fields, or scanning probes.  On a broader level, it may compete with directed self-assembly of micro- and nanostructures. Photolithography shares some fundamental principles with photography in that the pattern in the photoresist is created by exposing it to light — either directly by projection through a lens, or by illuminating a mask placed directly over the substrate, as in contact printing. The technique can also be seen as a high precision version of the method used to make printed circuit boards.  The name originated from a loose analogy with the traditional photographic method of producing plates for lithographic printing on paper; however, subsequent stages in the process have more in common with etching than with traditional lithography. Conventional photoresists typically consist of three components: resin, sensitizer, and solvent.},

  abstract = {The synthesis of nanocrystalline powders of zirconia often produces the tetragonal phase, which for coarse-grained powders is stable only at high temperatures and transforms into the monoclinic form on cooling. This stability reversal has been suggested to be due to differences in the surface energies of the monoclinic and tetragonal polymorphs. In the present study, we have used high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry to test this hypothesis directly. We measured the excess enthalpies of nanocrystalline tetragonal, monoclinic, and amorphous zirconia. Monoclinic ZrO2 was found to have the largest surface enthalpy and amorphous zirconia the smallest. Stability crossovers with increasing surface area between monoclinic, tetragonal, and amorphous zirconia were confirmed. The surface enthalpy of amorphous zirconia was estimated to be 0.5 J/m2. The linear fit of excess enthalpies for nanocrystalline zirconia, as a function of area from nitrogen adsorption (BET) gave apparent surface enthalpies of 6.4 and 2.1 J/m2, for the monoclinic and tetragonal polymorphs, respectively. Due to aggregation, the surface areas calculated from crystallite size are larger than those measured by BET. The fit of enthalpy versus calculated total interface/surface area gave surface enthalpies of 4.2 J/m2 for the monoclinic form and 0.9 J/m2 for the tetragonal polymorph. From solution calorimetry, the enthalpy of the monoclinic to tetragonal phase transition for ZrO2 was estimated to be 10±1 kJ/mol and amorphization enthalpy to be 34±2 kJ/mol.},

Since then, it has been subject of many further publications including the demonstration of the world's first ferroelectric field‐effect transistor in the state‐of‐the‐art 28 nm technology. Though many studies are conducted with a strong focus on application in memory devices, a comprehensive study on structural stability in these films remains to be seen. In this work, a film thickness of about 36 nm, instead of the 10 nm used in most previous studies, is utilized to carefully probe how the concentration range impacts the evolution of phases, the dopant distribution, the field cycling effects, and their interplay in the macroscopic ferroelectric response of the films. Si:HfO               2               appears to be a rather fragile system: different phases seem close in energy and the system is thus rich in competing phenomena. Nonetheless, it offers ferroelectricity or field‐induced ferroelectricity for elevated annealing conditions up to 1000 °C. Similar to the measures taken for conventional ferroelectrics such as lead zirconate titanate, engineering efforts to guarantee stable interfaces and stoichiometry are mandatory to achieve stable performance in applications such as ferroelectric memories, supercapacitors, or energy harvesting devices.},

This method allows the cantilever to be operated at or near resonance for techniques where standard phase locked loops are not possible.

An example of the latter is piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), where the resonant frequency of the cantilever is strongly dependent on the contact stiffness of the tip–surface junction and the local mechanical properties, but the spatial variability of the drive phase rules out the use of a phase locked loop. Combined with high-voltage switching and imaging, dual-frequency, resonance-tracking PFM allows reliable studies of electromechanical and elastic properties and polarization dynamics in a broad range of inorganic and biological systems, and is illustrated using lead zirconate–titanate, rat tail collagen, and native and switched ferroelectric domains in lithium niobate.},

During repeated field programming and erase of the polarization state of initially pristine HfO2‐based ferroelectric capacitors, the magnitude of the measured polarization increases, a phenomenon known as “wake‐up”. In this study, the authors attempt to understand what causes the wake‐up effect in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) capacitors using nondestructive methods that probe statistically significant sample volumes. Synchrotron X‐ray diffraction reveals a concerted shift in HZO Bragg peak position as a function of polarization switching cycle number in films prepared under conditions such that they exhibit extremely large (≈3000\%) wake‐up. In contrast, a control sample with insignificant wake‐up shows no such peak shift. Capacitance – voltage measurements show evolution in the capacitance loop with switching cycle number for the wake‐up sample and no change for the control sample. Piezoresponse force microscopy measurements are utilized to visualize the domain switching with wake‐up. The combination of these observations clearly demonstrates that wake‐up is caused by a field‐driven phase transformation of the tetragonal phase to the metastable ferroelectric orthorhombic phase during polarization switching of HZO capacitors.},

  abstract = {For the rather new hafnia- and zirconia-based ferroelectrics, a lot of questions are still unsettled. Among them is the electric field cycling behavior consisting of (1) wake-up, (2) fatigue, and (3) the recently discovered subcycling-induced splitup/merging effect of transient current peaks in a hysteresis measurement. In the present work, first-order reversal curves (FORCs) are applied to study the evolution of the switching and backswitching field distribution within the frame of the Preisach model for three different phenomena: (1) The pristine film contains two oppositely biased regions. These internal bias fields vanish during the wake-up cycling. (2) Fatigue as a decrease in the number of switchable domains is accompanied by a slight increase in the mean absolute value of the switching field. (3) The split-up effect is shown to also be related to local bias fields in a complex situation resulting from both the field cycling treatment and the measurement procedure. Moreover, the role of the wake-up phenomenon is discussed with respect to optimizing low-voltage operation conditions of ferroelectric memories toward reasonably high and stable remanent polarization and highest possible endurance.},

The quest for low temperature deposition techniques is motivated in the perspective of contemporary trends in microchip technology such as 3D integration and the ending miniaturization. Reduced temperature depositions tend to deliver lower quality films. This is illustrated with the relation between deposition temperature and thin dielectric film quality (dielectric strength).

  abstract = {Since the first report of ferroelectricity in a Si-d oped HfO2 film in 2011, HfO2-based materials have attracted much interest from the ferroelectric materials and devices community. However, in HfO2-b ased bulk materials, the ferroelectric phase is not the one with the lowest free energy. It is, therefore, crucial to identify the possible thermodynamic and kinetic drivers for such an unexpected phase formation. The main difference between this type of material and conventional perovskite-b ased ferroelectrics is the movement of oxygen ions upon polarization switching, which complicates the structural examination of samples. Nonetheless, concerted efforts in academia and industry have substantially improved our understanding of the material properties and root causes of the unexpected formation of the ferroelectric phase. These insights help us understand how to induce the polar phase even in bulk materials. In this Review, we discuss in depth the properties and origin of ferroelectricity in HfO2-b ased materials, carefully evaluating numerous reports in the field, which are sometimes contradictory, and showing how thermodynamic and kinetic factors influence phase formation almost equally. We also survey possible applications and prospects for further development.},

This finding confirms experimental results for lanthanum and gadolinium showing the highest remanent polarization values of all hafnia-based ferroelectric films until now. However, no comprehensive overview that links structural properties to the electrical performance of the films in detail is available for lanthanide-doped hafnia. La:HfO2 appears to be a material with a broad window of process parameters, and accordingly, by optimization of the La content in the layer, it is possible to improve the performance of the material significantly. Variations of the La concentration leads to changes in the crystallographic structure in the bulk of the films and at the interfaces to the electrode materials, which impacts the spontaneous polarization, internal bias fields, and with this the field cycling behavior of the capacitor structure. Characterization results are compared to other dopants like Si, Al, and Gd to validate the advantages of the material in applications such as semiconductor memory devices.},

  abstract = {The global energy crisis and environmental pollutions caused mainly by the increased consumption of nonre­ newable energy sources prompted researchers to explore alternative energy technologies that can harvest en­ ergies available in the ambient environment. Mechanical energy is the most ubiquitous ambient energy that can be captured and converted into useful electric power. Piezoelectric transduction is the prominent mechanical energy harvesting mechanism owing to its high electromechanical coupling factor and piezoelectric coefficient compared to electrostatic, electromagnetic, and triboelectric transductions. Thus, piezoelectric energy harvesting has received the utmost interest by the scientific community. Advancements of micro and nanoscale materials and manufacturing processes have enabled the fabrication of piezoelectric generators with favorable features such as enhanced electromechanical coupling factor, piezoelectric coefficient, flexibility, stretch-ability, and integrate-ability for diverse applications. Besides that, miniature devices with lesser power demand are realized in the market with technological developments in the electronics industry. Thus, it is anticipated that in near future, many electronics will be powered by piezoelectric generators. This paper presents a comprehensive re­ view on the state-of-the-art of piezoelectric energy harvesting. The piezoelectric energy conversion principles are delineated, and the working mechanisms and operational modes of piezoelectric generators are elucidated. Recent researches on the developments of inorganic, organic, composite, and bio-inspired natural piezoelectric materials are reviewed. The applications of piezoelectric energy harvesting at nano, micro, and mesoscale in diverse fields including transportation, structures, aerial applications, in water applications, smart systems, microfluidics, biomedicals, wearable and implantable electronics, and tissue regeneration are reviewed. The advancements, limitations, and potential improvements of the materials and applications of the piezoelectric energy harvesting technology are discussed. Briefly, this review presents the broad spectrum of piezoelectric materials for clean power supply to wireless electronics in diverse fields.},

Pulsed laser deposition is one of the multiple physical vapour deposition routes to fabricate thin films, employing laser energy to eject material from a target in the form of a plasma. A substrate, commonly a single-crystal oxide, is placed in the path of the plume and acts as a template for the arriving species from the target to coalesce and self-assemble into a thin film. This technique is tremendously useful to produce crystalline films, due to the wide range of atmospheric conditions and the extent of possible chemical complexity of the target. However, this flexibility results in a high degree of complexity, oftentimes requiring rigorous optimisation of the growth parameters to achieve high quality crystalline films with desired composition. In this tutorial review, we aim to reduce the complexity and the barrier to entry for the controlled growth of complex oxides by pulsed laser deposition. We present an overview of the fundamental and practical aspects of pulsed laser deposition, discuss the consequences of tailoring the growth parameters on the thin film properties, and describe               in situ               monitoring techniques that are useful in gaining a deeper understanding of the properties of the resultant films. Particular emphasis is placed on the general relationships between the growth parameters and the consequent structural, chemical and functional properties of the thin films. In the final section, we discuss the open questions within the field and possible directions to further expand the utility of pulsed laser deposition.},

In-plane X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that the (Hf0.5Zr0.5)O2 thin films deposited on SiO2 and Si substrates were under in-plane tensile strain and that their volume fraction of monoclinic phase decreased as this strain increased. In contrast, films deposited on CaF2 substrates were under in-plane compressive strain, and their volume fraction of monoclinic phase was the largest among the three kinds of substrates. The maximum remanent polarization of 9.3 μC/cm2 was observed for Pt/(Hf0.5Zr0.5)O2/Pt/TiO2/SiO2, while ferroelectricity was barely observable for Pt/(Hf0.5Zr0.5)O2/Pt/TiO2/SiO2/CaF2.

Using Landau-Ginsburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory for the analysis of the experimental results, it is shown here that, in thin (5\,nm) HZO, depolarization fields drive the system in a stable paraelectric phase coexisting with a metastable ferroelectric one, which explains the pinched hysteresis. This state of matter resembles a first order ferroelectric above the Curie temperature which is known to result in similar double-loop behavior. Here, based on the analysis of experimental data in the framework of LGD theory, it is reported that charge injection and trapping at pre-existing interface defects during field cycling (“wake-up”) screens the depolarization field stabilizing ferroelectricity. It is found in particular that a sufficiently large energy density of interface states is beneficial for the recovery of fully open ferroelectric loops.},

The digital format of AFM images allows for direct utilization in ML algorithms without the need for additional processing. Additionally, AFM enables the simultaneous imaging of distributions of over a dozen different physicochemical properties of sample surfaces, a process known as multidimensional imaging. While this wealth of information can be challenging to analyze using traditional methods, ML provides a seamless approach to this task. However, the relatively slow speed of AFM imaging poses a challenge in applying deep learning methods broadly used in image recognition. This prospective is focused on ML recognition/classification when using a relatively small number of AFM images,               aka               small database. We discuss ML methods other than popular deep-learning neural networks. The described approach has already been successfully used to analyze and classify the surfaces of biological cells. It can be applied to recognize medical images, specific material processing, in forensic studies, even to identify the authenticity of arts. A general template for ML analysis specific to AFM is suggested, with a specific example of the identification of cell phenotype. Special attention is given to the analysis of the statistical significance of the obtained results, an important feature that is often overlooked in papers dealing with machine learning. A simple method for finding statistical significance is also described.},

  abstract = {Yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) materials are routinely used as thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). The phase composition and microstructure of YSZ materials significantly influence their properties. In this study, ZrO2 ceramics composed respectively of monoclinic ZrO2 (mZrO2), tetragonal YSZ (t-YSZ) and cubic YSZ (c-YSZ) phases were sintered. The effect mechanism of phase composition and microstructure on thermophysical and mechanical properties were investigated by experiment together and numerical calculation. The result indicates that YSZ materials with c-YSZ phase are more suitable as TBC materials in terms of heat insulation, thermal expansion match with the metal substrate, and strain tolerance. The YSZ ceramic with c-YSZ phase also exhibits lower thermal conductivity than those composed of the t-YSZ and m-ZrO2 phases due to its greater lattice distortion, number of oxygen vacancies, and lower sound velocity as a result of greater Y2O3 doping. Bond lengths and cohesive energy calculations based on first principles reveal that the reason that the Y2O3 doping causes the CTE values of ZrO2 to increase is due to the bonding between ions becoming weaker, and the c-YSZ phase exhibits the highest CTE value. Firstprinciples calculations also indicate that the c-YSZ phase exhibits a lower elastic modulus and better malleability and plasticity than m-ZrO2 and t-YSZ phases. However, the t-YSZ phase has better fracture toughness due to toughening under stress and finer grains.},

  abstract = {New interest in microscopic studies of ferroelectric materials with low piezoelectric coefficient, d3∗3, has emerged after the discovery of ferroelectric properties in HfO2 thin films, which are the main candidate for the next generation of nonvolatile ferroelectric memory. The study of the microscopic structure of ferroelectric HfO2 capacitors is crucial to get insights into the device behavior and performance. However, a small d3∗3 of ferroelectric HfO2 films leads to a low piezoresponse, especially in band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy (BE-PFM). In this work, we have implemented the BE-PFM technique with an increased scanning rate, thus improving this versatile tool for weak ferroelectrics. The acceleration of measurement was achieved by focusing excitation into a narrow frequency band and tuning the central frequency on-the-fly using an online real-time model estimation by fitting a complex BE response. The tracking of the contact resonance frequency was implemented using a pure mechanical cantilever response acquired in BE atomic force acoustic microscopy. To obtain optimal excitation parameters, we perform statistical analysis by minimizing estimator variance. The measurement precision of several PFM techniques was compared both by the simulation and experimentally using a Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based ferroelectric capacitor.},

However, studying the weak response from ultra-thin film requires improved measurement sensitivity. In general, resonance-enhanced piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has been used to characterize ferroelectricity by fitting a simple harmonic oscillation model with the resonance spectrum. However, an iterative approach, such as traditional least squares (LS) fitting, is sensitive to noise and can result in the misunderstanding of weak responses. In this study, we developed the deep neural network (DNN) hybrid with deep denoising autoencoder (DDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to extract resonance information. The DDA/PCA-DNN improves the PFM sensitivity down to 0.3\,pm, allowing measurement of weak piezoresponse with low excitation voltage in 10-nm-thick Hf               0.5               Zr               0.5               O               2               thin films.

  abstract = {The new class of fully silicon-compatible hafnia-based ferroelectrics with high switchable polarization and good endurance and thickness scalability shows a strong promise for new generations of logic and memory devices. Among other factors, their competitiveness depends on the power efficiency that requires reliable low-voltage operation. Here, we show genuine ferroelectric switching in HfxZr(1–x)O2 (HZO) layers in the application-relevant capacitor geometry, for driving signals as low as 800 mV and coercive voltage below 500 mV. Enhanced piezoresponse force microscopy with sub-picometer sensitivity allowed for probing individual polarization domains under the top electrode and performing a detailed analysis of hysteretic switching. The authentic local piezoelectric loops and domain wall movement under bias attest to the true ferroelectric nature of the detected nanodomains. The systematic analysis of local piezoresponse loop arrays reveals a totally unexpected thickness dependence of the coercive fields in HZO capacitors. The thickness decrease from 10 to 7 nm is associated with a remarkably strong decrease of the coercive field, with about 50\% of the capacitor area switched at coercive voltages ≤0.5 V. Our explanation consistent with the experimental data involves a change of mechanism of nuclei-assisted switching when the thickness decreases below 10 nm. The practical implication of this effect is a robust ferroelectric switching under the millivolt-range driving signal, which is not expected for the standard coercive voltage scaling law. These results demonstrate a strong potential for further aggressive thickness reduction of HZO layers for low-power electronics.},

  abstract = {HfO2-based ferroelectrics have dramatically changed the application perspectives of polarization-switching materials for information processing and storage. Their CMOS compatibility and preservation of high reversible polarization down to a few nanometer thickness make them attractive for various device concepts including non-volatile memories and negative-capacitance-enhanced steep-slope transistors. In the context of these applications, the long-standing discussion of intrinsic (thermodynamic) or extrinsic nuclei-limited switching (NLS) in ferroelectrics has recently gained importance. In particular, the negative capacitance effect that is formally described by the Landau–Ginzburg–Devonshire formalism implies the intrinsic polarization switching driven by the thermodynamic coercive field. On the other hand, recent studies reported the nucleation-limited extrinsic switching, which does not result in the hysteresis-free negative capacitance effect. Here, we analyze the polarization response in the nanometer scale on the ferroelectric/dielectric bilayer where the negative capacitance has been previously demonstrated. Our analysis of the two limiting cases of quasi-static switching and the earlier reported ultrafast polarization response supports the intrinsic polarization reversal scenario. The compatibility of this mechanism with the previously reported NLS region-by-region switching with remarkably low domain wall velocity is addressed. Our results confirm the usability of CMOS-compatible polycrystalline HZO ferroelectric films for gates operating in the negative-capacitance regime. Furthermore, they point towards possible solutions for optimizing their switching properties for applications including memories.},

However, due to the size limit of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, von Neumann‐based computing systems are facing multiple challenges (such as memory walls). As the number of transistors required by the neural network increases, the development of neural networks based on the von Neumann computer is limited by volume and energy consumption. As the fourth basic circuit element, memristor shines in the field of neuromorphic computing. The new computer architecture based on memristor is widely considered as a substitute for the von Neumann architecture and has great potential to deal with the neural network and big data era challenge. This article reviews existing materials and structures of memristors, neurophysiological simulations based on memristors, and applications of memristor‐based neural networks. The feasibility and advancement of implementing neural networks using memristors are discussed, the difficulties that need to be overcome at this stage are put forward, and their development prospects and challenges faced are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon of polarization imprint consisting of the development of a preferential polarization state in ferroelectric films is known as one of the major issues impacting the development of high density ferroelectric memories. According to the commonly accepted scenario, the imprint is related to the charge injection and charge accumulation in the nearby-electrode passive layer of the ferroelectric film. Recent studies demonstrated that the coercive voltage shift induced by the imprint exhibits a nonlinear time dependence in a logarithmic scale. This result was interpreted as the presence of two different imprint mechanisms characterized by different activation energies. In the present work, an analytical theory of the injection scenario of imprint is developed. The charge accumulation at the interface is shown to provoke a voltage offset and polarization loss which are nonlinearly dependent on the time in logarithmic scale. This result is obtained for different charge injection mechanisms including Schottky, Pool-Frenkel, and tunneling scenarios. Thus, it is shown that a single imprint mechanism can be responsible for a nolinear (in logarithmic scale) time dependence of the voltage offset and polarization loss. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the logarithmic rate of imprint is shown to be nonexponential. The developed model ties together the time and temperature dependences of imprint. For the experimental verification of the model a study of imprint has been performed on (111) Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 film capacitors with temperatures ranging from 25 to 150°C and exposure times up to 1000h. It has been found that the theory developed adequately describes the obtained experimental data. Based upon the theoretical and experimental results a test for ferroelectric memories is proposed, which enables the long-term prediction of polarization loss caused by imprint for a wide temperature range and for different operating voltages.},

The abrupt volume expansion and sudden development of polarization at the phase transition has been extensively investigated in PbZrO3-based perovskite ceramics. New research developments in these compositions, including the incommensurate domain structure, the auxetic behavior under electric fields in the induced ferroelectric phase, the ferroelastic behavior of the multicell cubic phase, the impact of radial compression, the unexpected electric field-induced ferroelectric-to-antiferroelectric transition, and the phase transition mechanical toughening effect have been summarized. Due to their significance to lead-free piezoelectric ceramics, compounds with antiferroelectric phases, including NaNbO3, AgNbO3, and (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3, are also critically reviewed. Focus has been placed on the (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3–BaTiO3 solid solution where the electric field-induced ferroelectric phase remains even after the applied field is removed at room temperature. Therefore, the electric field-induced antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition is a key to the poling process to develop piezoelectricity in morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions. The competing phase transition and domain switching processes in 0.93(Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3–0.07BaTiO3 are directly imaged with nanometer resolution using the unique in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique.},

  abstract = {Sodium niobate (NN) lead-free perovskites have been concentrated on due to high performance and abundant phase structure. The complex structure evolution has become a hot topic of research for this kind of materials. In this work, antiferroelectric phase is recovered by introducing La3+ dopant from modified ferroelectric states, indicating reversible composition-induced antiferroelectric-ferroelectric (AFE-FE) phase transition in NN-based ceramics. Significantly, change tendency of decreasing first and then increasing appears for phase transition temperature with increasing La3+, which is different from general phenomenon for ions dopant. Antiferroelectric orthorhombic (Pbma) is induced from ferroelectric tetragonal (P4mm) with a transient state of paraelectric cubic (Pm3m) via enhancing La3+. Further, substitution on A-site and A/B-sites are revealed with low and high content of La3+, respectively, accompanied by decreased first and then increased oxygen vacancy. Moreover, obviously deteriorated piezoelectric response is observed along with poor domain switching due to the vanishing ferro­ electric domain for FE-PE-AFE phase transition. Meanwhile, weak strain, piezoelectric and dielectric properties are observed for antiferroelectric phase with antiparallel dipoles, while enhanced strain and dielectric permit­ tivity are gained around ferroelectric-paraelectric coexistence or paraelectric region originating from electric field-induced ferroelectric state from polar nanoregions. Thus, this work demonstrated an abnormal phase transition in NN-based ceramics, promoting the understanding of antiferroelectrics.},

  abstract = {At variance with structural ferroic phase transitions which give rise to macroscopic tensors coupled to macroscopic fields, criteria defining antiferroelectric (AFE) phase transitions are still under discussion due to the absence of specific symmetry properties characterizing their existence. They are recognized by the proximity of a ferroelectric (FE) phase induced under applied electric field, with a double hysteresis loop relating the induced polarization to the electric field and a typical anomaly of the dielectric permittivity. Here, we show that there exist indeed symmetry criteria defining AFE transitions. They relate the local symmetry of the polar crystallographic sites emerging at an AFE phase transition with the macroscopic symmetry of the AFE phase. The dielectric properties of AFE transitions are deduced from a Landau theoretical model in which ferroelectric and ferrielectric phases are shown to stabilize as the result of specific symmetry-allowed couplings of the AFE order- parameter with the field-induced polarization.},

  abstract = {Sr1−xYxCoO2.65 (x=0.2) with layered perovskite structure was studied by neutron diffraction, synchrotron x-ray and magnetometry methods. It is shown that in the 90–375 K temperature range the crystal structure can be described by the monoclinic space group A2/m with the superstructure 4√2ap ×2√2ap ×4ap (with ap corresponding to the unit cell parameter of the primitive cell) while basic diffraction peaks are well indexed in the space group I4/mmm (2ap ×2ap ×4ap) shows an almost standard magnetization. The basic magnetic structure is G-type antiferromagnetic with average magnetic moments of 2.7 μB/Co and 1.7 μB/Co in anion-deficient CoO4+γ and stoichiometric CoO6 layers, respectively. A ferromagnetic component of about 0.27 μB/Co is determined from the magnetization measurements at 8 K. Sr0.8Y0.2CoO2.65 shows an almost standard magnetization versus temperature dependence whereas Sr0.75Y0.25CoO2.65 exhibits an antiferromagnet-ferromagnet transition accompanied by a structural transformation. There is practically no spontaneous magnetization in x=0.3. The type of the magnetic structure and the high value of TN suggest that the Co3+ ions are in both structural layers predominantly in the low-spin (LS)/high-spin (HS) state mixture. It is proposed that the ferromagnetic component is due to the orbital ordering occurring at TN in the CoO5 pyramids and the concomitant appearance of ferromagnetic coupling between the Co3+(HS) ions located in these CoO5 pyramids in the anion-deficient CoO4+γ layer.},

  abstract = {Ferroelectric materials have remained one of the major focal points of condensed matter physics and materials science for over 50 years. In the last 20 years, the development of voltage-modulated scanning probe microscopy techniques, exemplified by Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and associated time- and voltage spectroscopies, opened a pathway to explore these materials on a single-digit nanometer level. Consequently, domain structures and walls and polarization dynamics can now be imaged in real space. More generally, PFM has allowed studying electromechanical coupling in a broad variety of materials ranging from ionics to biological systems. It can also be anticipated that the recent Nobel prize [“The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016,” http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel\_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/ (Nobel Media, 2016)] in molecular electromechanical machines will result in rapid growth in interest in PFM as a method to probe their behavior on single device and device assembly levels. However, the broad introduction of PFM also resulted in a growing number of reports on the nearly ubiquitous presence of ferroelectric-like phenomena including remnant polar states and electromechanical hysteresis loops in materials which are non-ferroelectric in the bulk or in cases where size effects are expected to suppress ferroelectricity. While in certain cases plausible physical mechanisms can be suggested, there is remarkable similarity in observed behaviors, irrespective of the materials system. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of PFM, briefly discuss the features of ferroelectric surfaces salient to PFM imaging and spectroscopy, and summarize existing reports on ferroelectric-like responses in non-classical ferroelectric materials. We further discuss possible mechanisms behind observed behaviors and possible experimental strategies for their identification.},

  abstract = {It is commonly believed that the impact of the top electrodes on the ferroelectricity of hafnium-based thin films is due to strain engineering. However, several anomalies have occurred that put existing theories in doubt. This work carries out a detailed study of this issue using both theoretical and experimental approaches. The 10 nm Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) films are prepared by atomic layer deposition, and three different top capping electrodes (W/MO/ITO) are deposited by physical vapor deposition. The electrical testing finds that the strain does not completely control the ferroelectricity of the devices. The results of further piezoelectric force microscopy characterization exclude the potential interference of the top capping electrodes and interface for electrical testing. In addition, through atomic force microscopy characterization and statistical analysis, a strong correlation between the grain size of the top electrode and the grain size of the HZO film has been found, suggesting that the grain size of the top electrode can induce the formation of the grain size in HZO thin films. Finally, the first-principles calculation is carried out to understand the impact of the strain and grain size on the ferroelectric properties of HZO films. The results show that the strain is the dominant factor for ferroelectricity when the grain size is large ({$>$}10 nm). However, when the grain size becomes thinner ({$<$}10 nm), the regulation effect of grain sizes increases significantly, which could bring a series of benefits for device scaling, such as device-todevice variations, film uniformity, and domain switch consistency. This work not only completes the understanding of ferroelectricity through top electrode modulation but also provides strong support for the precise regulation of ferroelectricity of nanoscale devices and ultrathin HZO ferroelectric films.},

  abstract = {Hafnium dioxide ­(HfO2)-based ferroelectric films are highly desirable due to their excellent compatibility with CMOS technology, good scalability, low operating voltage, and moderate polarization strength. However, the preparation of ­HfO2-based ferroelectric films inevitably introduces oxygen vacancies, which, under the influence of electric fields, redistribute and cause the awakening and fatigue phenomena of the films, ultimately resulting in the loss of ferroelectric performance. In this study, ­Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films were grown using atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology, and the influence of using different metal electrodes (W, Pt) as the top and bottom electrodes on the electrical properties of the HZO films was investigated. The leakage current of the W/HZO/W capacitor was the lowest, and the initial 2Pr at 3 V was 41.4 μC/cm2, much higher than those of the W/HZO/Pt (15.7 μC/cm2) and Pt/HZO/Pt (7.6 μC/cm2) capacitors. As the number of electric field cycles gradually increased to ­104, the 2Pr values of the three capacitors changed. At this point, the 2Pr value of the W/HZO/W capacitor was 53.9 μC/cm2, and the characteristic fatigue curve was flatter, indicating a weaker wake-up effect. These results indicate that the W electrode material can effectively promote the formation of the ferroelectric phase, reduce oxygen vacancies, and suppress the wake-up effect.},

  abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the great success of deep neural networks in various domains. However, deep neural networks are very resource-intensive in terms of energy consumption, data requirements, and high computational costs. With the recent increasing need for the autonomy of machines in the real world, e.g., self-driving vehicles, drones, and collaborative robots, exploitation of deep neural networks in those applications has been actively investigated. In those applications, energy and computational efficiencies are especially important because of the need for real-time responses and the limited energy supply. A promising solution to these previously infeasible applications has recently been given by biologically plausible spiking neural networks. Spiking neural networks aim to bridge the gap between neuroscience and machine learning, using biologically realistic models of neurons to carry out the computation. Due to their functional similarity to the biological neural network, spiking neural networks can embrace the sparsity found in biology and are highly compatible with temporal code. Our contributions in this work are: (i) we give a comprehensive review of theories of biological neurons; (ii) we present various existing spike-based neuron models, which have been studied in neuroscience; (iii) we detail synapse models; (iv) we provide a review of artificial neural networks; (v) we provide detailed guidance on how to train spike-based neuron models; (vi) we revise available spike-based neuron frameworks that have been developed to support implementing spiking neural networks; (vii) finally, we cover existing spiking neural network applications in computer vision and robotics domains. The paper concludes with discussions of future perspectives.},

  abstract = {Abstract             To realize highly efficient neuromorphic computing that is comparable to biological counterparts, bioinspired computing systems, consisting of biorealistic artificial synapses and neurons, are developed with memristive devices with native dynamics resembling biological synapses and neurons. Tremendous materials and devices have been successfully used to emulate diverse functions of synapses, as well as neurons, in the last decade. Herein, approaches to realize certain synaptic or neuronal functions are introduced with state‐of‐art experimental demonstrations. First, the dynamics and working principles of biological synapses and neurons are briefly presented to provide guidance for developing biorealistic synapses and neurons. Second, recent advances in the development of memristive synapses with homosynaptic and heterosynaptic plasticity are disscussed. In particular, approaches to realize the important learning rules, like spiking‐timing‐dependent plasticity and Bienenstock–Cooper–Munro learning rules, are elaborated according to the level of faithfulness to biological synapses. Memristive neurons, including bioplausible neurons and biophysical neurons, are described. Finally, challenges and perspectives for bioinspired computing based on memristive devices are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {The AI and IoT era requires software and hardware capable of efficiently processing massive amounts data quickly and at a low cost. However, there are bottlenecks in existing Von Neumann structures, including the difference in the operating speed of current-generation DRAM and Flash memory systems, the large voltage required to erase the charge of nonvolatile memory cells, and the limitations of scaled-down systems. Ferroelectric materials are one exciting means of breaking away from this structure, as Hf-based ferroelectric materials have a low operating voltage, excellent data retention qualities, and show fast switching speed, and can be used as non-volatile memory (NVM) if polarization characteristics are utilized. Moreover, adjusting their conductance enables diverse computing architectures, such as neuromorphic computing with analog characteristics or ‘logic-in-memory’ computing with digital characteristics, through high integration. Several types of ferroelectric memories, including two-terminal-based FTJs, three-terminal-based FeFETs using electric field effect, and FeRAMs using ferroelectric materials as capacitors, are currently being studied. In this review paper, we include these devices, as well as a Fe-diode with high on/off ratio properties, which has a similar structure to the FTJs but operate with the Schottky barrier modulation. After reviewing the operating principles and features of each structure, we conclude with a summary of recent applications that have incorporated them.},

The IL also enriches ferroelectricity and retention properties. When integrated into crossbar arrays, FeCaps and FeFETs demonstrate their effectiveness as IMC components, eliminating sneak paths and enabling selector-less operation, leading to notable improvements in energy efficiency and area utilization. However, it is worth noting that limited capacitance ratios in FeCaps introduced errors in multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) computations. The proposed co-design approach helps in mitigating these errors and achieves high accuracy in classifying the CIFAR-10 dataset, elevating it from a baseline of 10\% to 81.7\%. FeFETs in crossbars, with a higher on-off ratio, outperform FeCaps, and our proposed charge-based sensing scheme achieved at least an order of magnitude reduction in power consumption, compared to prevalent current-based methods.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of ferroelectricity (FE) in HfO2-based thin films, they are gaining increasing attention as a viable alternative to conventional FE in the next generation of non-volatile memory devices. In order to further increase the density of elements in the integrated circuits, it is essential to adopt a three-dimensional design. Since atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes are extremely conformal, ALD is the favored approach in the production of 3D ferroelectric random access memory. Here, we report the fabrication of fully ALD-grown capacitors comprising a 10-nm-thick FE Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 layer sandwiched between TiN electrodes, which are subjected to a detailed investigation of the structural and functional properties. The robust FE properties of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films in capacitors are established by several alternative techniques. We demonstrate a good scalability of TiN/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/TiN FE capacitors down to 100-nm size and the polarization retention in the test “one transistor-one capacitor” (1T-1C) cells after 1010 writing cycles. The presence of a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase responsible for FE properties in the alloyed polycrystalline Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films is established by transmission electron microscopy. Given the ability of the ALD technique to grow highly conformal films and multilayered structures, the obtained results indicate the route for the design of FE non-volatile memory devices in 3D integrated circuits.},
